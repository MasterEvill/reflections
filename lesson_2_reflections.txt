What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The .git directory gets created with files containing all metadata needed to initialize
the project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary area where you can control which files you want to commit together.
