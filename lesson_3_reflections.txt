When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are collaborating with other contributors.  When you need to have a backup of your repository.  When you want to share your work to the world.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Doing it manually gives you control on when and which changes to pull.  What's in the remote (latest) might not be best for you or what you need at the moment.
